It is a multidisciplinary approach that\\ncombines principles and practices from the fields of\\nmathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer\\nengineering to analyze large amounts of data.\\nIn Wikipedia, Data Science is defined as a scientific field\\nthat uses scientific methods to extract knowledge and insights from\\nstructured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and\\nactionable insights from data across a broad range of application\\ndomains.Why Data Science?Why Data Science?\\n\\uf097 Data is the oil for today’s world.

To apply data science principles to\\nrunning a business, one first needs to collect some data,\\ni.e. translate business processes into digital form. This is\\nknown as digitalization. Applying data science\\ntechniques to this data to guide decisions can lead to\\nsignificant increases in productivity called digital\\ntransformation.Data Science ComponentsData Science Components\\nStatistics & VisualizationStatistics & Visualization\\n\\uf097 Statistics is the most critical unit of Data\\nScience basics, and it is the method or\\nscience of collecting and analyzing\\nnumerical data in large quantities to get\\nuseful insights.\\n\\uf097 Visualization technique helps us access\\nhuge amounts of data in easy to\\nunderstand and digestible visuals.Machine Learning & Deep LearningMachine Learning & Deep Learning\\n\\uf097 AI enables the machine to think, that is without any human\\nintervention the machine will be able to take its own decision.\\n\\uf097 Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses\\nstatistical learning algorithms to build systems that have the\\nability to automatically learn and improve from experiences\\nwithout being explicitly programmed.\\n\\uf097 Deep learning is a machine learning technique that is inspired\\nby the way a human brain filters information, it is basically\\nlearning from examples. It helps a computer model to filter the\\ninput data through layers to predict and classify information.Data EngineeringData Engineering\\n\\uf097 Data engineering refers to the building of\\nsystems to enable the collection and\\nusage of data. This data is usually used to\\nenable subsequent analysis and data\\nscience; which often involves machine\\nlearning.Advanced ComputingAdvanced Computing\\n\\uf097 It refers to systems with the ability to\\nprocess data and perform calculations at\\nhigh speeds, such as supercomputers.Data Science ProcessData Science Process\\nDiscoveryDiscovery\\nDiscovery step involves acquiring data from all the\\nidentified internal & external sources, which helps\\nus answer the business question.\\nThe data can be:\\n\\uf097 Logs from webservers\\n\\uf097 Data gathered from social media\\n\\uf097 Census datasets\\n\\uf097 Data streamed from online sources using APIsPreparationPreparation\\n\\uf097 Data can have many inconsistencies like\\nmissing values, blank columns, an\\nincorrect data format, which needs to be\\ncleaned. We need to process, explore, and\\ncondition data before modelling. The\\ncleaner our data, the better are our\\npredictions.Model PlanningModel Planning\\n\\uf097 In this stage, we need to determine the\\nmethod and technique to draw the\\nrelation between input variables. Planning\\nfor a model is performed by using\\ndifferent statistical formulas\\nand visualization tools. SQL analysis\\nservices, R, and SAS/access are some of\\nthe tools used for this purpose.Model BuildingModel Building\\n\\uf097 In this step, the actual model building\\nprocess starts. Here, Data scientist\\ndistributes datasets for training and\\ntesting. T echniques like association,\\nclassification, and clustering are applied to\\nthe training data set. The model, once\\nprepared, is tested against the “testing”\\ndataset.OperationOperation\\n\\uf097 We deliver the final baselined model with\\nreports, code, and technical documents in\\nthis stage. Model is deployed into a real-\\ntime production environment after\\nthorough testing.Communicate ResultsCommunicate Results\\n\\uf097 In this stage, the key findings are\\ncommunicated to all stakeholders. This\\nhelps us decide if the project results are\\nsuccess or failure based on the inputs\\nfrom the model.T ools for Data ScienceT ools for Data Science\\nJavaJava\\n\\uf097 Java can be used for many of the processes:\\n\\uf097 Data import and export.\\n\\uf097 Cleaning data.\\n\\uf097 Statistical analysis.\\n\\uf097 Machine learning and Deep learning.\\n\\uf097 Deep learning.\\n\\uf097 T ext analytics (also known as Natural \\nLanguage Processing or NLP).\\n\\uf097 Data visualization.RR\\n\\uf097 R is a popular programming language used \\nfor statistical computing and graphical \\npresentation.\\n\\uf097 Its most common use is to analyze and \\nvisualize data.Why Use R?Why Use R?\\n\\uf097 It is a great resource for data analysis, data visualization, \\ndata science and machine learning\\n\\uf097 It provides many statistical techniques (such as \\nstatistical tests, classification, clustering and data \\nreduction)\\n\\uf097 It is easy to draw graphs in R, like pie charts, histograms, \\nbox plot, scatter plot, etc..\\n\\uf097 It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)\\n\\uf097 It is open-source and free\\n\\uf097 It has a large community support\\n\\uf097 It has many packages (libraries of functions) that can be \\nused to solve different problemsPythonPython\\n\\uf097 Python is open source, interpreted, high\\nlevel language and provides great\\napproach for object-oriented\\nprogramming. It is one of the best\\nlanguage used by data scientist for various\\ndata science projects/application. Python\\nprovide great functionality to deal with\\nmathematics, statistics and scientific\\nfunction. It provides great libraries to\\ndeals with data science application.SASSAS\\nSAS stands for Statistical Analysis\\nSoftware. It was created in the year\\n1960 by the SAS Institute.
