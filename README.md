## GeminiMinds
This project is a dynamic Interview Question Generator that leverages Google's Gemini model and LangChain to generate intelligent and diverse interview questions. Designed to streamline the process of question generation, this tool is especially useful for recruiters, educators, and interview preparers.

### Project Overview
The Interview Question Generator is designed to produce tailored interview questions based on specific topics or keywords. Utilizing Gemini for natural language understanding and LangChain to structure coherent queries, this generator outputs a diverse range of questions suited to technical, behavioral, and situational interview scenarios.

This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with continuous integration set up using GitHub Actions for seamless deployment.

### Features
* **Natural Language Understanding**: Uses Gemini for processing context and generating relevant questions.
* **Customizable Topics**: Generates questions based on any input topic or keyword.
* **Types of Questions**: Supports various question types such as technical, behavioral, and situational.
* **Real-time Deployment**: Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access.
* **Automated Deployment**: Configured with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
